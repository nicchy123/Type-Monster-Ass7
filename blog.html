           <p class="fs-5 mt-2">
            sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

            <h2 class=" text-center d-inline">(2) Global Scope VS Block Scope</h2>
           <p class="fs-5 mt-2">
            In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like. in javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are contained in this global scope. Another is the Local Scope, variables declared inside the functions are considered to be of the local scope and it is futher divided into function scoped and block scoped

            <h2 class=" text-center d-inline">(3) How Event Loop Work</h2>
           <p class="fs-5 mt-2">
            JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event")

            <h2 class=" text-center d-inline">(4) How We Get Undefined in js</h2>
           <p class="fs-5 mt-2">
            A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned
